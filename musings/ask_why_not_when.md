# Ask why, not when

"They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing."
\- Adele

This is aspirational advice, for myself. I hesitate to recommend it to others, because I don't follow it myself.

The tl;dr is: don't be in search of lost time, but do what you can to forget that time exists.

## "Are you know that...?"

Growing up, I constantly nagged my older siblings with questions that started with that phrase. As the grammatical incorrectness of the phrase itself might suggest, often I'd follow it up with something simplistic, wrong, or entirely random - wherever my child brain took me. It was exciting to be constantly learning and trying to impress them.

In high school, I had a forcing function to continue this intellectual curiosity. The most convenient way to get to school was to catch a ride with my father when he left. Pretty standard! - except dad had to be the first one in to his construction site every morning. So I spent 4 years in a Starbucks every morning for three hours before school started. 

With little else to do, I read. A lot. There was a period where it would be more appropriate to ask _who_ I was reading, not _what_ I was reading - because I was going through authors, one corpus at a time.

## The cracked hourglass

For two years in college, that all fell away. There were so many competing concerns. I lived with all my friends. There were parties every weekend. Academics was very difficult in a way I'd never experienced before - I probably slept less in high school, but that was of my own volition. College forced me to prioritize my time.

It took me about two years after college to rehabilitate my interests and my intellectual curiosity. For a while, I couldn't help but speed-read, fueled by too much caffeine and an innate sense for how damn long whatever it was I was doing was taking. I finally broke out of that by deliberately spending about a quarter (by now I'm in the corporate world, hence quarters!) focused on a project that had been on the backburner since, well, senior year of high school (a hint at what it relates to is in this, and the next, paragraph header).

## In good stead

These days, I constantly reorient myself within the trifecta of: what interests me, what is impactful, and what is healthy and good for me as a social, physical human being. But I find myself guided on all fronts by time, to my detriment. I cut workouts short because I need to go to work so I can be done by a certain time to do xyz, I decide not to dive deep into a hairy issue at night because I want to get up early, I choose to focus on x instead of y because of z in the short term.

Having more things that I want to do, that are physically and financially accessible to me, than I have time for is a tremendous privilege. My problem is that I've become hyper-aware of all of these things, and everything else I could be doing.

There's value in just getting loose with it - working on something that intrigues you until an irresponsible hour in the morning; exploring abstract, intangible questions that don't have an immediate dividend.

## Don't let it bring you down

I offer this as an alternative to [Paul Graham's article on time](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html). His perspective is valuable - you should cut out bullshit that doesn't provide you any meaning or fulfillment. But, I exhort you, don't let the ever-ticking clock oppress you. 

The universe is infinitely complex. Your most valuable contribution might be in exploring some particular knot in this tangle. Think about the impact you could have on others. But don't make a cost-benefit analysis out of everything.

Think long term. Learn a language. Train for a marathon. Get really damn good at making pasta (and feed me!).
